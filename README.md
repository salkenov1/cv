Over the past few years, I have worked extensively with data systems, pipelines, and analytics â€” designing and maintaining end-to-end data workflows using tools like Python, SQL, dbt, ClickHouse, Airflow, and Power BI. My experience spans multiple domains including humanitarian data management, financial and academic analytics projects.

If you see this repository, then I am open to new positions and would be happy to discuss further details.
