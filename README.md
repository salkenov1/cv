Over the past few years, I have worked extensively with data systems, pipelines, and analytics â€” designing and maintaining end-to-end data workflows using tools like Python, SQL, dbt, ClickHouse, Airflow, and Power BI. My experience spans multiple domains including humanitarian data management, financial and academic analytics projects.
